# OptiFiber  TPM Portfolio Case Study

---

## 📋 Project Overview

**OptiFiber** is a centralized system for deployment tracking and performance monitoring. It improves fiber installation efficiency and provides real-time visibility into network performance metrics—including latency and throughput.

---

## 🎯 The Challenge

Without centralized tracking, fiber deployment is **slow, costly, and inconsistent**. Repeat visits and lack of visibility hurt efficiency and customer satisfaction.

### Key Pain Points

- 🔴 High installation costs due to inefficiencies
- 🔴 Inconsistent deployment timelines
- 🔴 Limited real-time network visibility
- 🔴 Poor customer satisfaction scores

---

## 💡 The Solution

Build a platform that integrates installation workflows, telemetry data, and live performance metrics to detect issues early, reduce provisioning failures, and increase first-time installation success.

### Project Objectives

✅ Centralize deployment tracking and monitoring

✅ Reduce installation time and costs

✅ Improve network visibility and performance metrics

✅ Increase customer satisfaction through faster, reliable deployments

---

## 📦 Project Scope

### ✅ In Scope

- Requirements gathering and stakeholder alignment
- API integration to collect telemetry data
- Dashboard for installation and performance metrics
- Alerting system for abnormal network behavior
- Pilot rollout with a small region
- Documentation and training materials

### ❌ Out of Scope

- Vendor changes
- New network hardware manufacturing
- Large-scale operational hiring
- CRM architecture redesign
